## Project Purpose and Goals

The GetFood landing page is the cornerstone of a larger application, providing a scalable and modifiable base. It's a testament to the essential front-end technologies that make up modern web applications. With a focus on mobile-first design, we aim to optimize for search engines and performance, while also prioritizing accessibility to uplift the user experience.

## Web Stack and Explanation

Semantic HTML elements define the content structure with a focus on SEO. Pure CSS crafts the visual identity, while JavaScript is sparingly used to enrich the interactivity with smooth scrolling and sticky navigation features.
